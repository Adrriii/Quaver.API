# What's Included
We want to make it as easy and seamless as possible for developers to use the same tools as what is utilized in Quaver. Everything regarding map parsing, difficulty calculation, replays, and conversions from other games are packed into this one library. That means if we change **anything** about anything, you'll have everything.

The namespaces we have are as follows:

* [Quaver.API.Maps](https://github.com/Swan/Quaver-API/tree/master/Quaver-API/Maps) - Contains classes related to .qua files, our song file format including parsing and difficulty calculation
* [Quaver.API.Enums](https://github.com/Swan/Quaver-API/tree/master/Quaver-API/Enums) - A ton of enums used throughout the game which we hope you can find useful.
* [Quaver.API.Osu](https://github.com/Swan/Quaver-API/tree/master/Quaver-API/Osu) - Contains classes related to osu! conversion to Quaver
* [Quaver.API.StepMania](https://github.com/Swan/Quaver-API/tree/master/Quaver-API/StepMania) - Contains classes related to StepMania conversion to Quaver
